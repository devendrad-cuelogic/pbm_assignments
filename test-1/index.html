    Question:
    Without using any form field elements in the solution, on page load, start tracking keyboard entries. Whenever the sequential letters exactly match with any of the 140 color names listed on <a href="http://www.html-color-names.com/color-chart.php" title="">http://www.html-color-names.com/color-chart.php</a> , let the page background color change to the same color. When the next color name is typed, the page background would change to that color. And so on. Mismatched letters would be ignored. You can assume that there are no elements on the page. You can create them dynamically, if you need, but no form field elements.
